# terraform { required_version = ">= 1.0.0" } block in a Terraform configuration file specifies the version constraints for the Terraform CLI (Command Line Interface) that should be used to run the configuration. 


# Every module can have different versions, just like providers or any other software component. Module versions are managed independently from each other, and they can be updated and versioned according to the module's development lifecycle and release schedule
